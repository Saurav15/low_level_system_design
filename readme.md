# Low-Level System Design (LLD) Practice

Welcome to the **Low-Level System Design (LLD) Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to solving LLD problems by implementing structured and efficient solutions using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices.

## 📌 Objectives

- Strengthen LLD skills by implementing real-world design problems.
- Practice OOP concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- Learn and apply Design Patterns.
- Write modular, reusable, and scalable code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript / Java / Python (Choose as needed)
- **Design Principles**: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Testing**: Jest / JUnit / PyTest (Optional)

## 🚀 How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lld-practice.git
   cd lld-practice
   ```
2. **Pick a problem and read the requirements** (in `problems/problemX/README.md`).
3. **Design the solution** using OOP principles.
4. **Implement the solution** in the chosen language.
5. **Test your implementation** using unit tests.
6. **Document your approach** and commit your changes.
7. **Push the solution** and track your progress!

## ✅ Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Requirements**: Read the problem statement carefully.
2. **Identify Entities & Relationships**: Break the problem into classes and relationships.
3. **Define Class Diagram**: Sketch relationships using UML (Optional).
4. **Implement the Design**: Write clean, maintainable code.
5. **Test with Sample Cases**: Verify correctness and edge cases.

## 📖 Topics to Cover

- Object-Oriented Design Principles
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)
- Thread-Safe Implementations (if applicable)
- API Design Considerations
